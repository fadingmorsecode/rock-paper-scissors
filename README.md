Tired of having no one to play rock paper scissors with? This is perfect for you!
A classic game of rock paper scissors against the computer. See if you can beat the computer in five rounds.
# Project Summary
Skills utilized in this project include: manipulating the DOM, using multiple event listeners, functions, and if statements. One thing I noticed was being more comfortable in using arrow functions and the syntax required. 

I had a lot of fun putting the skills that I have learned so far to the test!
